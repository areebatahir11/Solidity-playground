<h1 align="center">🧠 Solidity Playground 🚀</h1>


Welcome to my **Solidity Playground** – a dedicated space where I experiment, learn, and practice smart contract development using **Solidity** and **Remix IDE**.  

### 📚 What I’ve Learned So Far

Each folder or file in this repository explores a focused concept. Here's what I’ve covered:

- 🔸 **Variables & Functions** – State vs local variables, visibility (public/private/internal/external)
- 🔸 **Data Structures** – `struct`, `array`, `mapping`, `nested mappings`
- 🔸 **Function Modifiers** – `onlyOwner`, custom checks, DRY principles
- 🔸 **Require & Error Handling** – Input validation, access control
- 🔸 **Visibility Specifiers** – Understanding contract exposure
- 🔸 **Security Patterns** – ✅ Reentrancy guard, ✅ Access control via modifiers
- 🔸 **Hashing with `keccak256`** – Basics of digital fingerprinting and pseudo-randomness
- 🔸 **Inheritance & `Ownable`** – Secure function restriction and admin controls
